# github-drama (community fork)

This is a curated collection of "dramatic" GitHub interactions.

## Contributing to github-drama

This repo is intended to point out comical interactions that come up in the world of
software development, and not to harass anyone. Sometimes tensions build up in
online interactions, and the intention of github-drama is to allow
participants to take a step back from the drama and say to themselves, "damn,
I need to chill".

### Phylogenetic tree

This repository is
[github-drama/github-drama](https://github.com/github-drama/github-drama).
The GitHub Drama community forked and created this repository in 2022.
The ancestry is
[nikolas/github-drama](https://github.com/nikolas/github-drama).
Relatives include [paradite/github-dramas](https://github.com/paradite/github-dramas).

### How do I find drama?

Go into a GitHub project's issues, and sort by "Most commented" or "Most reactions".

### What qualifies as drama?

There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included
in github-drama. Everyone has a different sense of humor. There are plenty
of "non-serious" GitHub threads, where the usual GitHub politeness gives
way to reaction GIFs and one-word replies, turning into something like a
4chan thread, but less funny.

This repository follows the guideline that if anyone in the thread appears to
be getting worked up about something, it can be considered for inclusion here.
If a repository's maintainer has locked conversation on a thread, that's also
a good indicator that it could be included here.

* The itoddlers can't figure out why they can't copy or paste with the clipboard manager and can't find any fix. Several people with the problem complain, and the problem is widespread due to the Ventura update. Finally, after much struggle, the issue is closed.

* Summary:
  * The issue evolves from being a straightforward in-progress task to something completely unexpected.
  * A maintainer on Arch User Repository comes out of the woodwork to elaborate on a problem specific to Arch Linux. Everyone involved goes back and forth because the key to the issue is non-obvious and a real hack due to how Fedora searches paths.
  * The original issue opener manually compiles the clipboard manager and posts cryptic logs until someone puts a patch into place. However, every window gets squished and jumps around whenever Sway WM users copy text due to an unpleasant feature inherent in Wayland.

* Summary
  * Zloirock maintains the core-js library on millions of websites and has spammed the console of numerous developers who indirectly import core-js. (source: [issues/635](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/issues/635))
  * According to The Register, Zloirock is a Russian who was once unable to maintain core-js when he served about ten months in prison in 2020 for colliding with two pedestrians on his motorcycle, killing one.
    (source:
      [The Register 2020](https://www.theregister.com/2020/03/26/corejs_maintainer_jailed_code_release),
      [The Register 2023](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/15/corejs_russia_open_source)
    )
  * Zloirock said he's ready to give up open-source development because few people pay for core-js.
  * Zloirock posted a 10000-word screed and opened an issue on GitHub titled "So, what's next?" in February 2023.
